## Introduction: Berries' production in Jalisco and their importance for rural development

Berry cultivation — including strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries — has become one of the most dynamic agricultural activities in Jalisco. These crops are considered high‑value and are strongly export‑oriented, contributing significantly to the rural economy and positioning Mexico as a global leader in berry exports.

According to the Mexican government, berries are the second agricultural product with the highest export value nationwide, underscoring their strategic importance for rural development and the competitiveness of Jalisco’s agricultural sector (SENASICA 2025). This expansion presents an opportunity to design rural development strategies that support the sector through targeted investments in technology, infrastructure, and labor training.

However, for such policies to be effective, it is essential that the government understands the spatial distribution of berry cultivation and the factors explaining these patterns. Evidence‑based policymaking can ensure that subsidies and support programs are directed to municipalities where agroclimatic conditions, labor availability, and logistical advantages combine to maximize the impact of public investment.

## Project design

This project investigates the spatial determinants of berry cultivation in Jalisco, Mexico, focusing on strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries. Using municipality-level data, I will model the relationship between agroclimatic suitability (altitude, precipitation, temperature, and water availability) and the surface area cultivated with berries. I will then incorporate proximity to federal highways to account for logistical advantages in export-oriented production. Moreover, as a labor-intensive crop, the model will also consider the number of workers employed in agriculture.

To test for spatial clustering effects beyond these variables, I will estimate a spatial lag regression model, assessing whether the presence of neighboring plantations significantly improves predictive power. I will use Moran’s I to measure spatial autocorrelation in the residuals before and after introducing the spatial lag term, allowing me to evaluate whether clustering is driven by unobserved spatial dynamics such as access to specialized services or cold storage.

The findings aim to inform rural development strategies by identifying spatial barriers and opportunities for expanding high-value agriculture.

## Hypothesis framing the research question

*Null Hypothesis (H₀):* The presence and extent of berry plantations in Jalisco municipalities are fully explained by agroclimatic conditions, number of people dedicated to agriculture, and proximity to federal highways. There is no additional spatial clustering effect beyond these variables.

*Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):* Berry plantations exhibit spatial clustering that cannot be fully explained by agroclimatic conditions, demographics, or highway proximity — suggesting that proximity to other plantations (e.g., access to specialized services or cold storage) significantly influences their location.

## Initial coding and data preparation

*0. Explore the shapefile for the 125 municipalities of Jalisco*

The coordinates for the polygons corresponding to each of the 125 municipalities of Jalisco where retrieved from the government agency dedicated to demographic and geographic information, INEGI.

The shapefile has the 125 polyogons corresponding to each of the state's municipalities

```{r}
#| label: JuanFinalProject-init
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

jalisco_mun <- st_read("LimiteMunicipal2012/LimiteMunicipal2012.shp")
plot(jalisco_mun)
```

*1. Calculate the average elevation for each municipality:*

Install the elevatr package first

```{r}
install.packages("elevatr")
```

Computation of average elevation // this process takes time

```{r}
library(sf)
library(terra)
library(elevatr)
library(dplyr)

# 1. Load municipalities
jalisco_mun <- st_read("LimiteMunicipal2012/LimiteMunicipal2012.shp") %>%
  st_transform(4326)

# 2. Download DEM covering Jalisco
jalisco_dem <- get_elev_raster(
    locations = jalisco_mun,
    z = 12,         # resolution level
    clip = "locations"
)

dem <- rast(jalisco_dem)

# 3. Convert sf → terra
jalisco_v <- vect(jalisco_mun)

# 4. Extract mean elevation
avg_alt <- extract(dem, jalisco_v, fun = mean, na.rm = TRUE)

# 5. Add to shapefile
jalisco_mun$avg_elev_m <- avg_alt$mean
elev_col <- colnames(avg_alt)[2]   # second column is the elevation
jalisco_mun$avg_elev_m <- avg_alt[[elev_col]]

# 6. Final table
elevation_table <- jalisco_mun |>
  st_drop_geometry() |>
  select(municipio = NOMBRE, CVEGEO, avg_elev_m)

print(elevation_table)

# export to csv
write.csv(elevation_table, "jalisco_avg_elevation.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

*2. Calculate the average precipitation and temperatures for each municipality*

Install the package for geodata:

```{r}
install.packages("geodata")
```

Generate and save data:

```{r}
library(sf)
library(terra)
library(geodata)
library(dplyr)

# 1. Load Jalisco municipalities
jalisco <- st_read("LimiteMunicipal2012/LimiteMunicipal2012.shp")
jalisco <- st_transform(jalisco, 4326)

# terra objects for extract()
jalisco_v <- vect(jalisco)

# 2. Load WorldClim bioclimatic variables
bio <- worldclim_global(var="bio", res=2.5)

# Select correct temperature and precipitation layers
bio1  <- bio$wc2.1_2.5m_bio_1   # annual mean temp (°C *10)
bio5  <- bio$wc2.1_2.5m_bio_5   # max temp warmest month (°C *10)
bio6  <- bio$wc2.1_2.5m_bio_6   # min temp coldest month (°C *10)
bio12 <- bio$wc2.1_2.5m_bio_12  # annual precipitation (mm)

# 3. Extract zonal means for each municipality
mean_bio1  <- extract(bio1,  jalisco_v, fun = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
mean_bio5  <- extract(bio5,  jalisco_v, fun = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
mean_bio6  <- extract(bio6,  jalisco_v, fun = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
mean_bio12 <- extract(bio12, jalisco_v, fun = mean, na.rm = TRUE)

# 4. Add variables to dataset (BIO temps must be divided by 10)
jalisco$mean_temp_c     <- mean_bio1[,2]  / 10
jalisco$max_temp_c      <- mean_bio5[,2]  / 10
jalisco$min_temp_c      <- mean_bio6[,2]  / 10
jalisco$annual_prec_mm  <- mean_bio12[,2]

```

*3. Export table with municipal averages (temperature and precipitation):*

```{r}
library(dplyr)

averages_mun_table <- jalisco |>
  st_drop_geometry() |>
  select(CVEGEO, mean_temp_c, min_temp_c, max_temp_c, annual_prec_mm)

write.csv(averages_mun_table, "jalisco_municipal_avgs.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```

*4. Calculate adjacency to determine municipalities neighboring a berries producer*

For this I use a .dta file with information indicating which cvegeo (muncipality id) has berries

```{r}
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(haven)  # to read .dta files

# prepare data
jalisco_mun <- st_read("LimiteMunicipal2012/LimiteMunicipal2012.shp") %>%
  st_transform(4326)
has_berry_data <- read_dta("data/berry_places.dta")
jalisco_mun$CVEGEO <- as.character(jalisco_mun$CVEGEO)

# merge attributes
jalisco_mun <- jalisco_mun %>%
  left_join(has_berry_data, by = c("CVEGEO" = "cvegeo"))

# compute neighboring
jalisco_mun_fixed <- jalisco_mun %>%
  st_make_valid() %>%      # fuerza geometría válida
  st_collection_extract("POLYGON")   # en caso de multipolígonos extraños
neighbors_list <- st_touches(jalisco_mun_fixed)

# Create the neighbor berry indicator
berry_vec <- jalisco_mun$berry_place
neighbor_has_berries <- sapply(neighbors_list, function(nbs) {
  any(berry_vec[nbs] == 1, na.rm = TRUE)
})
jalisco_mun$neighbor_has_berries <- as.integer(neighbor_has_berries)

# transform file back to stata
final_data <- jalisco_mun %>%
  st_drop_geometry()

write_dta(final_data, "berry_places_with_neighbors.dta")

```

First run this cell to combine the geographic data (.shp) with the data about berries production.

```{r}
library(sf)
library(haven)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# --- Load data ---
jalisco_mun <- st_read("LimiteMunicipal2012/LimiteMunicipal2012.shp")
berries <- read_dta("data/berries_jalisco_2024.dta")

# --- Harmonize identifiers ---
jalisco_mun <- jalisco_mun %>% mutate(CVEGEO = as.character(CVEGEO))
berries <- berries %>% mutate(cvegeo = as.character(cvegeo))

# --- Merge datasets ---
jalisco_mun <- jalisco_mun %>%
  left_join(berries, by = c("CVEGEO" = "cvegeo"))
```

## Non-Spatial Correlation

*6. The standard OLS regression with explanatory variables.*

Using simple OLS regression with information avaible, we will assess the predictors for observing berries plantations in a municipality in Jalisco.

```{r}
# Standard OLS regression
ols_model <- lm(berry_place ~ avg_elev_m +
                  irrigation_ha_thousands + precipitation_good +
                  labor_ag_thousands + with_federal_highway +
                  surface_perc_ag,
                data = jalisco_mun)

summary(ols_model)

```

Residual standard error: 0.4033 on 118 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.2745, Adjusted R-squared: 0.2376 F-statistic: 7.439 on 6 and 118 DF, p-value: 9.052e-07

INTERPRETATION:

So far, from the non-spatial model, we know that the only significant variables —all of them positively correlated— that help to predict berries plantation are: - Precipitation being in optimal conditions for berries has p-value of 0.001 - Average elevation of the municipality has a p-value of 0.024 - Number of workers dedicated to agriculture has a p-value of 0.028

Surface dedicated to agriculture is negatively correlated. This means that larger municipalities with more extensive areas for agriculture is not in close relationship with this particular crop.

## Spatial Correlation: Moran's I

*7. Compute Moran's I on the residuals*

Before moving to spatial lag regression, we check whether residuals are spatially autocorrelated.

Steps: - Build a spatial weights matrix (based on municipality adjacency or distance). - Compute Moran’s I on the residuals of your OLS model.

```{r}
library(spdep)

# Create neighbors list from polygon boundaries
nb <- poly2nb(jalisco_mun)   # adjacency based on shared borders
lw <- nb2listw(nb, style = "W")  # row-standardized weights

# Moran's I test on OLS residuals
moran_test <- moran.test(residuals(ols_model), lw)
print(moran_test)
```

RESULTS:

```         
Moran I test under randomisation
```

data: residuals(ols_model)\
weights: lw

Moran I statistic standard deviate = 3.7265, p-value = 9.708e-05 alternative hypothesis: greater sample estimates: Moran I statistic Expectation Variance 0.215528846 -0.008064516 0.003600136

INTERPRETATION:

-   Moran’s I statistic = 0.216 → Positive and moderate spatial autocorrelation.
-   Expectation = -0.008 → What Moran’s I would be under pure randomness (close to zero).
-   Standard deviate = 3.73, p-value ≈ 0.000097 → Highly significant.

This means your OLS residuals are spatially clustered: municipalities with similar residuals are near each other. In other words, the non‑spatial regression is missing spatial dynamics.

## Spatial Lag Regresion

*8. Add a neighbors’ berry presence as a predictor*

Whether the neighboring municipality produces berries is a spatially lagged dependent variable.

```{r}
# Install package for spatial regression
install.packages("spatialreg") 
```

code for regression here:

```{r}

# load library
library(spatialreg)

# Spatial lag regression
slag_model <- lagsarlm(berry_place ~ avg_elev_m + irrigation_ha_thousands +
                         precipitation_good + labor_ag_thousands +
                         with_federal_highway + surface_perc_ag,
                       data = jalisco_mun,
                       listw = lw)

Log likelihood: -53.25478 for lag model ML residual variance (sigma squared): 0.1324, (sigma: 0.36387) Number of observations: 125 Number of parameters estimated: 9 AIC: 124.51, (AIC for lm: 136.49) LM test for residual autocorrelation test value: 0.48735, p-value: 0.48511

INTERPRETATION:

-   Rho (ρ) = 0.39, p \< 0.001 → Strong and statistically significant spatial dependence. Berry cultivation in one municipality is positively associated with cultivation in neighboring municipalities. This confirms the clustering effect you suspected.

-   Model fit (AIC = 124.5 vs OLS AIC = 136.5) → The spatial lag model fits better than the OLS baseline. Lower AIC means the SAR model explains the data more efficiently.

-   Residual autocorrelation test (LM test p = 0.485) → No significant spatial autocorrelation remains in the residuals. This means the lag model successfully absorbed the spatial clustering that OLS left behind.

-   Significant predictors: Altitude (avg_elev_m, p = 0.021) → Higher elevation increases likelihood of berry cultivation. Precipitation_good (p = 0.040) → Favorable precipitation conditions matter. Labor_ag_thousands (p = 0.035) → More agricultural workers increase berry cultivation. Surface_perc_ag (p = 0.059, marginal) → Higher share of land in agriculture is negatively associated (possibly competition with other crops).

-   Non‑significant predictors: Irrigation hectares (p = 0.16) Federal highway presence (p = 0.51)

## Conclusion of the spatial analysis

The Spatial Lag Model shows that neighboring municipalities’ berry cultivation has a strong spillover effect (ρ ≈ 0.39). This validates the hypothesis about clustering: berries are not only driven by agroclimatic and labor conditions, but also by spatial dynamics such as proximity to existing plantations, services, or cold storage.

*Policy interpretation*

-   Spatial spillovers suggest that supporting clusters (e.g., infrastructure, cold storage hubs) could amplify berry expansion.
-   Agroclimatic suitability and labor availability remain key, but clustering magnifies their effect

*Policy implications*

The spatial lag analysis confirms that berry cultivation in Jalisco is not only shaped by agroclimatic suitability and labor availability, but also by strong spillover effects from neighboring municipalities. This clustering dynamic suggests that subsidies for agricultural technologies will have greater impact if they are targeted toward municipalities already embedded in or adjacent to existing berry production zones.

By concentrating support in these clusters—such as precision irrigation, cold storage facilities, or improved transport logistics—the Department of Agriculture can leverage spatial spillovers to accelerate adoption and productivity gains. At the same time, prioritizing areas with favorable altitude and precipitation conditions ensures that subsidies align with natural suitability, while recognizing that labor-intensive production requires complementary investments in workforce training.

In practice, this means that subsidy programs should not be distributed uniformly across the state, but strategically directed to municipalities where agroclimatic advantages and spatial clustering combine to maximize the likelihood of sustained expansion in berry cultivation.
